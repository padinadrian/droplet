* What are the advantages of GB in comparison with other portable videogames?

  The same reflective LCD screen which is considered to be the weak point of
GameBoy, is its advantage. Other systems, such as Atari Lynx or SEGA GameGear,
use backlighted color screens which consume several times more power than
reflective LCD of GB. Thus, these systems need 6 AA batteries instead of 4 AAs
needed by GB and drain these batteries in about 6 hours. Also, dots on GB's
LCD are much smaller than dots on the color screens of other portables which
[given that you have a good light source nearby] means that GB's LCD looks
crisper. The other advantage of GameBoy is that it is the only portable
videogame you can actually PUT INTO YOUR POCKET. Both Lynx and GameGear are
too big for it. Speaking about variety of games available for GB, I would
*NOT* consider it an advantage of GB if we are talking solely about its
technical characteristics. Amount of software written for the system has
nothing to do with the system's hardware architecture. It is rather determined
by commercial success of the system and, in fact, by how it is marketed. There
are many technologically superior systems which just didn't make it because of
the poor marketing [TurboGrafx is an example].
