# Gameboy Tile Designer

## Notes


* When exporting:
    * First, save the project file (Ctrl-S or File -> Save)
    * Before exporting, go to View -> Tile Size and change it to 8x8
    * Scroll down to the end of the sprite list and note how many sprites there are.
      That is, actual sprites that you want exported, not the blank ones.
    * File -> Export to...
    * Make sure the filename is correct.
    * Type should be "GBDK files (*.c)"
    * Set "From" to 0 and "To" to the number of sprites (e.g. 39)
    * Click "Ok" to finish
